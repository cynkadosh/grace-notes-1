              <p>Grace notes helped me not to focus on my strength like fasting and prayer for security and deliverance 
              but I was refocused on Jesus, it became easy to live a christian life even after a such a hostile back ground.</p>
              <p>My leadership team was afraid to serve God, prior to that the were busy breaking deviles. Which kept in for years 
              in every service. I started teaching our congregation systematically thru Grace Notes.</p>

              <p>Grace Notes has done a great work in Zimbabwe and Africa at large. It has empowered ministers and churches. 
              This program has made me full of the Word and be able to teach what they know. Also GN has provided Bibles to 
              many of which some are poor that they could not afford it. We are happy that we met GN.</p>

              <p>The Christian who does not understand what God has done in
              the past, and who does not have faith in what God will do in the
              future, will be overwhelmed by today's crisis.</p>

            <p class="cambria">Many pastors and teachers use Grace Notes courses
            both for help in preparation for teaching and for use in classes held
            in Sunday schools, home schools, cell churches, and other venues where
            the Word of God is taught.</p>

            <p class="cambria">Grace Notes offers twelve (12) Units of course
            work, each unit roughly analogous to a semester of Bible College
            instruction. Students can earn certificates for each course completed,
            Unit certificates, and Diplomas for completing various portions of the
            curriculum. See the course descriptions here: <a href=
