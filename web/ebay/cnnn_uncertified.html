      should judge the grade as well as you can from the photographs. </p>
	  <p>I have tried to make my <strong>photographs</strong> show as much detail
	    as possible, given the problems associated with trying to get as close
	    to a true visual picture as possible. Please examine the photos carefully
	    and form your own judgment of the quality of the coin. </p>

          <td valign="top"><p><strong>I am not a coin dealer or grader</strong>.
              To try to grade coins, I use several professional publications.
              The best, in my opinion, is <em><strong>Official Guide to Coin
              Grading and Counterfeit Detection</strong></em>, published by the
              Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS). In this book, the standards
              for grading Mint State coins are explained and illustrated in great
              detail. Graders at the PCGS examine hundreds of coins every day,
              of every denomination, series, and condition. Their collective
              wisdom has been published in the Official Guide. Here is an excerpt
              from the book:</p>
            <p>&quot;Morgan dollars were usually transported in bags; thus most
              have marks and other surface impairments. Finding any date, other
              than the most common ones, is grades of MS-67 and higher is nearly
              impossible. Light contact on the highest points is evident even
              in the highest grades, as those coins that were stored in rolls
              also received some contact.</p>
            <p>&quot;For the lower grades of MS-60 to MS-62, marks are plentiful,
              with the face usually bearing the brunt of the impairments. The
              large, smooth cheek of Miss Liberty is a magnet for marks, with
              the field also being a very common area of impairment. Album slide
              marks are also common, as this is one of the most popular and highly
              collected series of any denomination. The reverse has less field
              area and sometimes marks are hidden in the eagle's feathers. The
              breast area is a high point, and severe marks are often seen on
              this device.&quot;</p>
            <p>Here are some of the grading criteria from the <strong>PCGS Guide</strong>.</p>
            <p class="style2">MS-65</p>
            <p class="style3"><strong>Marks</strong>: There may be some scattered marks, hairlines,
              or other minor defects. If the flaws are in a main focal area,
              they must be minor and few. Hidden marks and hairlines can be larger.
              On larger coins, there can be marks/hairlines in the fields and
              in the devices, but no major ones.<br>
              <strong>Strike</strong>: The coin will be well struck.<br>
              <strong>Luster</strong>: The luster will be average or above average,
              and any toning can only slightly impede the luster.<br>
              <strong>Eye Appeal</strong>: The eye appeal will be average or
              above. A coin may grade MS-65 with scattered, light marks, but
              with great luster and strike; or a coin with virtually no marks
              but a slightly impeded luster also could be MS-65. The overall
              eye appeal still must be positive or the coin does not merit the
              MS-65 grade. </p>
            <p class="style2">MS-64</p>
            <p class="style3"><strong>Marks</strong>: There may be numerous minor marks/hairlines,
              or other defects. There may be a few minor, or one or two significant,
              marks/hairlines in the main focal areas. On larger coins, these
              marks/hairlines may be more severe in the fields or main focal
              areas. However, a severe mark/hairline would have to be of a size
              that would preclude grading the coin MS-65, though not so severe
              as to reduce the coin to MS-63. If there are several fairly heavy
              marks/hairlines in obvious areas, the coin would grade MS-63 or
              lower.<br>
              <strong>Strike</strong>: The strike will range from average to
              full.<br>
              <strong>Luster</strong>: The luster can be slightly below average
              to full, and toning can impede the luster. On brilliant coins,
              there may be breaks in the luster caused by marks or hairlines.<br>
              <strong>Eye Appeal</strong>: The eye appeal can range from slightly
              negative to very positive. This is a nice coin, so anything too
              negative would preclude the MS-64 grade. Balance is a key. A coin
              with marks/hairlines in obvious focal areas would have to have
          great luster, or some other positive factor, to attain MS-64. </p>
            <p class="style2">MS-63</p>
            <p class="style3"><strong>Marks</strong>: There may be numerous marks/hairlines,
              including several major marks/hairlines in major focal areas. If
              there are distracting marks/hairlines on the major devices, the
              fields should be relatively clean. If there are distracting marks/hairlines
              in the fields, the devices should have less disurbance.<br>
              <strong>Strike</strong>: The strike will range from slightly below
              average to full.<br>
              <strong>Luster</strong>: The luster can be below average to full.
              The toning can seriously impede the luster. On brilliant coins,
              there can be significant breaks in the luster.<br>
              <strong>Eye Appeal</strong>:
              The eye appeal can be slightly negative to very positive. The &quot;average&quot; MS-63
              will have neutral eye appeal (noticeable marks/hairlines, average
              to above average strike, average luster). However, quite a few
              coins are graded MS-63 because of their negative appearance. If
              either the luster, strike, or marks are below the standards set
              forth here, the one of the other criteria must be exceptional for
              the coin to attain MS-63. </p>
            <p class="style2">MS-62</p>
            <p class="style3"><strong>Marks</strong>: The marks/hairlines may cover most of
              the coin. If the marks are light, they may be scattered across
              the entire coin. If ther are several severe marks, the rest of
              the coin should be relatively clean.<br>
              <strong>Strike</strong>: The strike can range from very weak (some
              New Orleans Mint Morgan dollars) to full.<br>
              <strong>Luster</strong>: The luster can range from poor to vibrant.<br>
              <strong>Eye Appeal</strong>: The eye appeal can
              be negative to slightly positive. The negativity in this grade
              usually involves excessive marks or a poor strike or a lack of
              luster, or unattractive toning. Even coins that have overall positive
              eye appeal usually have one or two areas that are negative.</p>
            <p class="style2">MS-61</p>
            <p class="style3"><strong>Marks</strong>: There may be numerous marks across the
              entire coin, and several severe contact marks or hairlines. On
              larger coins there may be areas with almost no marks.<br>
              <strong>Strike</strong>: The strike will range from very weak
              to full.<br>
              <strong>Luster</strong>: The luster may be poor, average, or full.<br>
              <strong>Eye Appeal</strong>: The eye appeal will be negative to
              slightly positive. </p>
            <p class="style2">MS-60</p>
            <p class="style3"><strong>Marks</strong>: Numerous. Marks will cover most of the
              coin's surface. The marks can be large and in prime focal areas.<br>
              <strong>Strike</strong>: The strike will range
              from very weak to full.<br>
              <strong>Luster</strong>: The luster can be below poor, average,
              or full.<br>
              <strong>Eye Appeal</strong>: The eye appeal can be very negative
              to neutral. </p>          </td>
