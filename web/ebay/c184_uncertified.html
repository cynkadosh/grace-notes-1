	  <p>This is an <strong>uncertified</strong> coin, so the grading shown is my
	    own estimate of the condition of the coin. Before you bid, you
      should judge the grade as well as you can from the photographs. </p>
	  <p>I have tried to make my <strong>photographs</strong> show as much detail
	    as possible, but it's hard to get a  true
	    visual picture in a photograph. Please examine the photos carefully and
	    form your own judgment of the quality of the coin.</p>
	  <p><strong>I will ship this coin to the USA only!! </strong></p>
	  <p><strong>Remember:</strong> your total cost is the <strong>bid price</strong> plus
	    the <strong>shipping</strong>. Be sure to check your total cost when judging
      what to pay for the coin.</p>

	  <p><strong>You will receive the coin that is in the photographs.</strong> Furthermore,

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><p>I consider this coin to be <strong>MS-64</strong>,
              because of the following details from  the PCGS Grading Standards.
              I have tried to be conservative, and you may well judge that the
              coin should have a different grade. </p>
            <p class="style2">MS-64</p>            <p class="style3"><strong>Marks</strong>: There may be numerous minor
              marks/hairlines, or other defects. There may be a few minor, or
              one or two significant, marks/hairlines in the main focal areas.
              On larger coins, these marks/hairlines may be more severe in the
              fields or main focal areas. However, a severe mark/hairline would
              have to be of a size that would preclude grading the coin MS-65,
              though not so severe as to reduce the coin to MS-63. If there are
              several fairly heavy marks/hairlines in obvious areas, the coin
              would grade MS-63 or lower.<br>
                <strong>Strike</strong>: The strike will range from average to
                full.<br>
                <strong>Luster</strong>: The luster can be slightly below average
                to full, and toning can impede the luster. On brilliant coins,
                there may be breaks in the luster caused by marks or hairlines.<br>
                <strong>Eye Appeal</strong>: The eye appeal can range from slightly
                negative to very positive. This is a nice coin, so anything too
                negative would preclude the MS-64 grade. Balance is a key. A
                coin with marks/hairlines in obvious focal areas would have to
          have great luster, or some other positive factor, to attain MS-64.</p></td>

          <td valign="top"><p><strong>I am not a coin dealer or grader</strong>.
              To try to grade coins, I use several professional publications.
              The best, in my opinion, is <em><strong>Official Guide to Coin
              Grading and Counterfeit Detection</strong></em>, published by the
              Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS). In this book, the standards
              for grading Mint State coins are explained and illustrated in great
              detail. Graders at the PCGS examine hundreds of coins every day,
              of every denomination, series, and condition. Their collective
              wisdom has been published in the Official Guide. Here is an excerpt
              from the book:</p>
            <p>&quot;Morgan dollars were usually transported in bags; thus most
              have marks and other surface impairments. Finding any date, other
              than the most common ones, is grades of MS-67 and higher is nearly
              impossible. Light contact on the highest points is evident even
              in the highest grades, as those coins that were stored in rolls
              also received some contact.</p>
            <p>&quot;For the lower grades of MS-60 to MS-62, marks are plentiful,
              with the face usually bearing the brunt of the impairments. The
              large, smooth cheek of Miss Liberty is a magnet for marks, with
              the field also being a very common area of impairment. Album slide
              marks are also common, as this is one of the most popular and highly
              collected series of any denomination. The reverse has less field
              area and sometimes marks are hidden in the eagle's feathers. The
              breast area is a high point, and severe marks are often seen on
              this device.&quot;</p>
