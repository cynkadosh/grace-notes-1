      <h3>Warren Doud</h3>
 <div class="indent">
       <p>My theological orientation, briefly, is evangelical Christian. I believe
that the Bible in its original manuscripts is divinely inspired and that
Jesus Christ is God and Savior. The Grace Notes doctrinal statement is adapted
  from my personal doctrinal position.</p>
<p>I graduated in 1957 from Prairie Bible Institute, Three Hills, Alberta, Canada,
with majors in Bible, English, and Christian Music.  I received the BS in Mathematics and Computer Science (1967), and an MS in Mathematics
(Abstract Algebra and Topology) (1969), from the University of Southwest Louisiana, Lafayette, LA.</p>
<p> Ethel and I spent several years in Christian work as a vocation: three
(3) years with Christian boarding school and mission in the U.S., as teacher
of math, French, and English. Three years as principal of Christian school in
Austin, Texas, in a local church, grades 2 to 12. I am an active Bible teacher and
writer.</p>
<p>I was employed from 1980 to 2011 as a computer information specialist and science
  writer with BAE SYSTEMS, the Analysis and Applied Research Division, Austin, TX. and with Ultra Electronics Advanced Tactical Systems.</p>

I am retired from work now and my Christian work is Bible teaching and writing and in the management of Grace Notes.</p>
