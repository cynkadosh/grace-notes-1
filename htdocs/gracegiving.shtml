		<h4>Grace Notes Teacher Training Projects</h4>
        <p class="cambria">
          All Grace Notes services or materials are free. All of the Authors of
          Grace Notes materials have graciously placed their work in the public
          domain, and they do not ask for compensation. The minimal overhead
          expenses are met by three or four regular donors who have supported
          the work for many years. No salaries are paid.
        </p>
        <p class="cambria">
          I hope that you will prayerfully consider adding resources to support
          the efforts of many pastor/teachers in Africa and other countries,
          who are using Grace Notes courses to train Bible teachers in their
          local churches.
        </p>
