<h1>Grace Notes Course Instructions </h1>
<h2>Starting a Course </h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Download the Lesson 1 file</strong>. This is an Adobe Acrobat
  Reader file (PDF). There is no need to register to do this; we
  will register you when you submit the first completed quiz (see
  below).
  </li>
  <li>To
  get a copy of the Lesson 1 Quiz, send an email to <a href="mailto:wdoud@gracenotes.info"><b>wdoud@gracenotes.info</b></a>.
  We will send you the complete Lesson 1, along with a quiz which
  you can email back to us when you have completed it.
  </li>
  <li>Study
  the lesson and complete the quiz; follow the instructions
  in the lesson file.
  </li>
  <li>Send
  the completed quiz file to Grace Notes. Either copy and paste the
  text into the body of an email message; or, send the text file as
  an email attachment. <strong>Be sure to state (in the Subject field)
    the Course name and Lesson number. </strong>
  The instructions for this are in both the lesson
  file and the quiz file. <strong>When
    you have submitted the first lesson's quiz, we will register you
    for the course. </strong>
  </li>
  <li>When
  we receive the quiz, we will email you the next lesson and quiz.

  you have completed all the lessons, we will mail a certificate
  of completion to the address you provide.</li>

<h2>General Notes on Grace Notes Courses</h2>
<p>Grace Notes
never charges any fee or tuition for Bible study materials. There is
certainly a cost involved, but we don&rsquo;t
want anyone to hesitate to request materials because of inability to
pay. The work is supported by Christians who pray for this effort and
share in the expenses. You can make a contribution using PayPal by
clicking on the <strong>Donate to Grace Notes</strong> button in the
left frame. 
<p> A course
is sent to you one lesson at a time, and there is a Quiz with each
lesson. When you finish studying Lesson 1, for example, you will complete
the Quiz and send it back to Grace Notes. Then, we will send you Lesson
2. This will continue until you have submitted the Quiz for the final
lesson in the course.&nbsp; When you complete the course, your &ldquo;transcript&rdquo; will
be updated in the Grace Notes database, and we will mail you a certificate
showing that you have completed the course.
<p>
This course is part of a larger Unit of work, and the Units are part
of an overall Bible Study Curriculum which leads to a Diploma of Biblical
Studies.
<p> A Unit
consists of several courses. The amount of material in a Unit is roughly
equivalent what you would find in one semester&rsquo;s
study at a Bible school.
<p>
As an example, the Grace Notes courses for Unit I are: <strong>Ruth,
  Titus, Foundations I, History I, and Doctrine I</strong>.
<p>
A <strong>Certificate of Completion</strong> is awarded for each course
you complete. Grace Notes will send you the certificate when you submit
the Quiz for the final lesson in the course.
<p>
An <strong>Award for Achievement</strong> will be awarded for the completion
of a Unit.
<p>
And, a <strong>Diploma in Biblical Studies</strong> will be awarded to
a person who completes Units I, II, III, and IV, equivalent to the amount
of material in two years of Bible school study.
<p> Visit the
Grace Notes web site to see all of the available courses.      
<p>You can
request any course from any unit; and you can study as many courses
at one time that you want. &nbsp; We
require that for the numbered courses (e.g. Doctrine I, II, III, IV)&nbsp; you
study the courses in order; but the non-numbered courses do not have
to be taken in sequence.
