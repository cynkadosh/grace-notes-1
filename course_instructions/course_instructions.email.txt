Grace Notes Course Instructions

Grace Notes is not an accredited school; the “credits” offered will probably not be transferable to
a Bible college or seminary.

STARTING A COURSE
If you don't specify a particular course that you want to receive, I will send you Lesson 1 of Titus and Lesson 1 of
Doctrine 100. If you would like to study a different course however, you can select any course in Units I to VII.
 
Students must complete Units I to VII before going on to courses in Units VIII to XII.
 
You can take as many courses at one time as you like. Many people do this to fill in the time during the exchange
of email messages. The numbered courses, such as Doctrine 100, 200, 300, and 400, or the History courses,
should be taken in order.

Study the lesson and complete the quiz; follow the instructions in the lesson file.
Use the reply feature of your email application to send the completed quiz file to Grace Notes. Be sure to state
(in the Subject field) the Course name and Lesson number.
The instructions for this are in both the lesson file and the quiz file. When you have submitted the first
lesson's quiz, I will register you for the course.
 
I will also send you the next lesson by Email.

General Notes on Grace Notes Courses
Grace Notes never charges any fee or tuition for Bible study materials. There is certainly a cost involved, but we
don't want anyone to hesitate to request materials because of inability to pay. The work is supported by Christians
who pray for this effort and share in the expenses. You can make a contribution using PayPal by clicking on the
Donate to Grace Notes button in the left frame on the web site.
Each course is part of a larger Unit of work, and the Units are part of an overall Bible Study Curriculum which leads
to a Diploma of Biblical Studies.
A Unit consists of several courses. The amount of material in a Unit is roughly equivalent what you would find in
one semesters study at a Bible school.
As an example, the Grace Notes courses for Unit I are: Ruth, Titus, Foundations 100, History 100, and Doctrine
100.
A Certificate of Completion is awarded for each course you complete. Grace Notes will send you the certificate
when you submit the Quiz for the final lesson in the course.
An Award for Achievement will be awarded for the completion of a Unit.
The
Associate in Bible Teaching
 diploma will be awarded to a person who completes Units 1, 2, 3, and 4,
equivalent to the amount of material in two years of Bible school study.
 
The
Senior Bible Teacher
 diploma is awarded for completing Units I to VIII.
 
The
Master Bible Teacher
 diploma is awarded for completing Units I to XII.
